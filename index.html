<p>I'm a graduate student in Indiana University's top-ranked Master of Public Affairs program, where I focus on data science for public administration. 
  Over my career, I've developed a professional interest in the application of data-driven technologies to equitably solve environmental and logistical challenges at scale. I'm currently seeking opportunities in program management and data analysis focused on the Great Lakes watershed.
<br>
<br>
My previous work includes the application of data science to local government procurement, analysis of digital political advertising spending in the 2018 midterms, comparative assessment of state bail reform, and Section 508 remediation for federal web content. 
  Outside the public sphere, Iâ€™ve worked on global supply chain analytics and financial reporting in the Fortune 100. Currently, I'm working on research projects focused on the Great Lakes.
