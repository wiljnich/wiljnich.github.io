<p>I'm a graduate student in Indiana University's top-ranked Master of Public Affairs program, where I focus on data science for resource systems analysis in the public sector. Over my career, I've developed a professional interest in the application of data-driven technologies to equitably solve environmental and logistical challenges at scale. Currently, I'm working on water data and policy at the Environmental Policy Innovation Center.

<br>
My previous work includes the application of data science to local government procurement, technology policy development for the Netherlands Ministry of Justice and Security, analysis of digital political advertising spending in the 2018 midterms, comparative assessment of state bail reform, and Section 508 remediation for federal web content. Outside the public sphere, Iâ€™ve worked on global supply chain analytics and financial reporting in the Fortune 100.
